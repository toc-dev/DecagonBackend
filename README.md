This is a Fintech application written in Flask.
The app is a platform for sending and receiving money in different currencies.
There are three levels of users. There is the Admin, the Elite, and the Noob
The Admin is the highest level, they do not own a wallet, but they can promote and demote the noob or elite
The admin also has to approve every transaction the noob does.
The elite can own as many wallets as they want in different currencies. They can also also send and receive money in whatever currency they want.
The noob can only own one wallet in one currency, and any money sent to the noob must first be converted to the currency of the noob's wallet.
Also, the admin must approve every transaction, before money is sent the noob's wallet.
